/**
 * This class is a central repository for information about a WordLL game: It stores a mystery word and all word guesses. Keeps history of past word guesses in linked structure
 * 
 * The most hardest method in this WordLL class I found was the tryWord, I was able to update label of all letters contained in Word guess by using the labelWord method and 
 * create a new node and get it to store the Word guess object then set current nodes next as history then update history to current node but then I struggled to figure out 
 * how would I identify if the Word guess is identical to the mystery Word first I decided to use the decorator() method and see if it equals ! and if so return true otherwise
 * return false, however i realized this will not work as WordLL class does not inherit Letter class so we cannot use decorator() helper method. Then I realized I have identified
 * if guess word entered by user is identical to mystery word in labelWord() method in Word class so then I checked if when invoking labelWord() method to check if Word guess is
 * identical to mysteryWord and if this method returns true, then return true otherwise if the labelWord() method returns false then return false. Then in the toString() method
 * I created a node and initialize it to the history of guesses then created a empty string called wordStr then until the current node has not reached the last letter of the guess 
 * word, I used string concatenation to print out the element of the current node and print new word on different line. And it gets the next node of the current node until it hasn't 
 * reached the end of word. These were the 2 methods that I felt were most challenging among all in this WordLL class. To test if my solution works, I created a main method, then I 
 * created a WordLL mysteryWord object which was ORDER and then made 3 guesses by calling 3 different Word objects with different words guessed: SHORE, REJECT, BEAR then I invoked 
 * the tryWord method in respect to the guessWord (so I invoked this 3 times for the 3 different guesses) then I invoked the toString() method to print out the wordLL object holding 
 * the mystery word and then when I ran this i noticed it correctly denotes the guess words with the accurate labelsâ€™ decorator according to my guesses and the mystery Word and this 
 * way I knew my code works correctly. The output of my code was: 
 * Word: -B-  +E+  -A-  +R+
 * Word: +R+ +E+ -J- !E! -C- -T-
 * Word: -S- -H- +O+ +R+ +E+
 * Which as we can see is correct according to mysteryWord which is ORDER (the ! denotes the letter is in right position + denotes letter is used in mystery word and - denotes word isnt used at all in mystery word)
